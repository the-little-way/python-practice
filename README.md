### python-practice

A repo for my python practice code. I'll try to add a new short project each week

**Week 1 is a km to miles converter** that automatically detects the typed units and converts to give a result. So if a user types 1km the code will detect km and convert to miles. This helps with user experience by giving the user a result in fewer actions.
